# Best Man Challenge — Minimal GitHub Pages Site

A super-light site with three pages: Home, About, and Questionnaire. Theme is black & white with gold accents.

## Local edits
- Replace the logo in `assets/img/logo.png` if you wish.
- In `questionnaire.html`, change the `data-email` value to your email so form answers open in an email to you.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repo (e.g., `best-man-challenge`).
2. Upload the contents of this folder to the repo root (index.html must be at the root).
3. In your repo, go to **Settings → Pages**.
4. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**, then pick `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
5. Save — after a minute or two, your site will be live at the Pages URL shown there.
